# Some notes
An API (Application Programming Interface) allows different software applications to communicate with each other. Flask is a lightweight Python web framework that is well-suited for developing RESTful APIs due to its simplicity and flexibility.

To get started with API development using Flask, you can follow this step-by-step guide:

Setting Up Flask: Install Flask using pip and set up a basic application.
Creating API Endpoints: Define routes and view functions to handle API requests.
Handling Data: Use request data and return JSON responses.
Testing the API: Use tools like Postman to test your API endpoints.
